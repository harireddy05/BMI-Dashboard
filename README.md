# Health-Dashboard
A micro project intended as a website to check the BMI and display a few other results based off of values entered for height and weight through the interface. The page uses HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and JavaScript.

This webpage includes 2 files -

The page also uses Bootstrap, which implies that you might need an internet connection (or download the source) and this URL to be active - https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.1.3/css/bootstrap.min.css

Instructions to run -

2. Copy the folder path
